### How does this work?

This is a shell script. It scrapes 1337x and gets the magnet link.
After this it uses [webtorrent](https://webtorrent.io/) to stream the video from the magnet link.
For scraping, the script uses simple gnu utils like sed, awk, paste, cut.

## Requirements

* [webtorrent](https://webtorrent.io/) - A tool to stream torrent. `npm install webtorrent-cli -g`

## Installation

### cURL
cURL **notflix** to your **$PATH** and give execute permissions.

```sh
$ sudo curl -sL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bugswriter/notflix/master/notflix" -o /usr/local/bin/notflix
$ sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/notflix
```
- To update, just do `curl` again, no need to `chmod` anymore.
- To uninstall, simply remove `notflix` from your **$PATH**, for example `sudo rm -f /usr/local/bin/notflix.

## How to Use
Since it can run in terminal too. There are two ways to use it:

### Dmenu
It is default in Dmenu so don't worry if you are using dmenu.

### Terminal
Because it is default in dmenu just comment dmenu variable on ```line 8``` by just adding a ```#``` :

```menu="dmenu -i -l 25"``` (before)

```#menu="dmenu -i -l 25"``` (after)
