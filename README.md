<p align="center">Removed the emojis from the script as its kinda cringe imo and made it less able to search porn, by only searching movies and not everything in general. Although it is still possible although, just it wont be as likely to come up</p>

### How does this work?

This is a shell script. It scrapes 1337x and gets the magnet link.
After this it uses [webtorrent](https://webtorrent.io/) to stream the video from the magnet link.
For scraping, the script uses simple gnu utils like sed, awk, paste, cut.

## Requirements

* [webtorrent](https://webtorrent.io/) - A tool to stream torrent. `npm install webtorrent-cli -g`

## Installation

### cURL
cURL **notflix** to your **$PATH** and give execute permissions.

```sh
$ sudo curl -sL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bugswriter/notflix/master/notflix" -o /usr/local/bin/notflix
$ sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/notflix
```
- To update, just do `curl` again, no need to `chmod` anymore.
- To uninstall, simply remove `notflix` from your **$PATH**, for example `sudo rm -f /usr/local/bin/notflix.
